# Pen-Plotter-Cad-405-TP
 This Repository was created to show the ME 405 pen-plotter CAD repository. It contains the STL files for print as well.

## **Description of Proposed Project**
Our  system is a 2.5 axis system that will act as a pen plotter. Our system is similar to the example idea where the arm rotates radially, however it is driven by the hub instead of driven by the wheel. The wheel freely rotates on a platform that provides leveling and stability for the sled. We used a 131:1 DC motor as the "elbow motor" and 

Instead of dropping the pen to write, we will be raising the edge of the platform using a solenoid placed at the far edge of the paper holder. The paper holder will be attached to a hinge that allows it to rotate out of reach of the pen.
